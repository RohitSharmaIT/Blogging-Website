# Weather Forecasting Web-App
The Blog Application built with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technologies. This web application allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as view and comment on posts from other users. The MERN stack provides a robust and scalable architecture for building modern web applications.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. Only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts.

- Create and Edit Posts: Authenticated users can create new blog posts and edit their existing posts. The rich text editor enhances the content creation experience.

- Delete Posts: Users can delete their own posts, removing them from the public view.

- View and Comment: Visitors can view all blog posts, including the ones from other users, and leave comments on the posts.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing blog posts, user information, and comments.

- **Express.js:** Backend framework for handling server-side logic and API routes.

- **React.js:** Frontend library for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for user authentication and securing API endpoints.

- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

- **Git:** Used for version control and collaboration during the development process.

- **GitHub:** Used for hosting the project's repository and managing version control, issues, and collaboration.
